<h2>Howto change permissions using FTP</h2>
<p>Most FTP-Clients are able to change the permissions for files. Of course every client is different but we want to give you some examples with some clients to change the permission. If you use another client and know how to make a screenshot we would be happy to include it into our examples - so send it to us.</p>
<p>Many times the change can be done by right-clicking on a file in the FTP-Client, using a special button or an extra menu entry. Search for functions named something like "Rights", "Permissions" or "Chmod" - maybe a look into the documentation will help.</p>
<p>Change the permission to &quot;777&quot; if it's done in numbers or search for the options to make it writable to everyone.</p>
<p><i>A word to the computer cracks:</i> It's clear to me that "777" is not always the best option but it will work with everybody's installation. Of course you can choose another (lower) value when you know what you are doing.</p>

<h3>Changing permissions using a text based FTP-client</h3>
<p>Using and oldschool FTP-client (like me ;)) - in this case ncftp:</p>
<pre>
  <code>
  ncftp&gt; open
  Connecting to xxxxxxxxxx...

  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx FTP server ready
  Logging in...                                                            
  User xxxxxxxxxxxxxx logged in.
  Logged in to xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx                                     

  ncftp / &gt; cd SiFiEx/
  ncftp /SiFiEx &gt; chmod 777 files
  ncftp /SiFiEx &gt; chmod 777 files/Standard
  ncftp /SiFiEx &gt; 
  </code>
</pre>
