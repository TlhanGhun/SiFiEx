0.2-Beta4
  - Some cleanup to the code
  - fixed a security issue (uploaded could be executed using PHP)
  - fixed a very bad bug in the automatic FTP setup (didn't work in 
    the old version at all - sorry for that)

0.2-Beta3
  - Added a function to try to change the permissions using PHP-builtin chmod

0.2-Beta2
  - Added the possibility to change permissions directly in the setup
    using FTP in SiFiEx itself

0.2-Beta1
  - Completely rewritten setup process
    o on first start a special setup page is displayed
    o permissions on config.php and files-folder are checked and displayed
    o if there are unsufficiant permissions a howto including examples
      and screenshots is displayed
 Known limitations:
  - files with special characters in the name can cause problems

 Upgrade from 0.1.1 to 0.2: Just copy the new files over the old installation
  - if you want to have a look at the new setup: delete or rename your
    config.php and it will be started on the next access to the start page

0.1.1
  - added many CSS-classes and ids for flexible themes - every
    single part of SiFiEx can now exclusivly been styled
  - if no file is in the upload directory a hint is displayed
  - display of filenames can be shortened if they are to long for a nice display - see new config parameter
    Example: veryVeryVeryLongFilename becomes something like veryV..ename
  - upload form is now not always visble but only after clicking
    on a buttom (see also new translations)

new entries in configuration
 o maxFilenameLength: maximum length of filename to be displayed
   before it is cutted. Leave 0 to not cut the filename at all
   Just use for the display - the filename itself won't be altered

new entries for translations:
 o noFilesAvailable: shown if no files are in the upload directory
 o unExpandUpload: Cancel upload form
 o expandUpload: open upload form
