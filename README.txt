This is the first quick and dirty Readme fpr SiFiEx.

Just upload the extracted folder to your FTP-Webspace and make sure that the user running the PHP-Scripts is allowed to write and delete files in the included folder "files".

You can change some configurations by editing config.php. configg.php will be created right after the first time of accessing SiFiEx using a browser by copying config.php.templ to config.php. Of course you can also copy it in this way by yourself if you want to have a config.php before the first access to SiFiEx

You should provide password protection to the whole SiFiEx - see using .htaccess on http://www.freewebmasterhelp.com/tutorials/htaccess/3 for example

IMPORTANT
!!! More documentation to come when 0.1 will be finished !!!
